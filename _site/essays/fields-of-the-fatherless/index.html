<p class="harbour-md italic mb-10">&mdash;Proverbs 23:10-11</p>

<section class="essay-body">
<p>I always come back to Proverbs.  It's my pole star.  I sit in my kitchen - before first light, while the rest of the house sleeps around me - and I read Proverbs.  And the more I read it, the more I come to see it as a sort of blueprint describing the momentum that keeps us all, and our natures, in motion.  In turn, the movements of God's nature and ours become apparent, like the inside of my head is a planetarium - the verses and chapters and various characters (the wise man and the fool, Wisdom and Folly) wheeling across my field of vision like constellations.  Proverbs is not so much a description of <em>what</em> we ought to be doing with ourselves and our lives, but a description of <em>how</em> the world and its creator work.</p>
<p>There's a great scene in <em>White Men Can't Jump</em>, where Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson argue about appreciating Jimi Hendrix's music:</p>
<p>Wesley: &quot;No, no, no.  There's a difference between <em>hearing</em> and <em>listening</em>.  You see?  White people - y'all can't <em>hear</em> Jimi.  You, you, you - you <em>listen</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Whenever I approach Proverbs, I hear Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson bickering in the back of my mind.  I yearn to hear some good news and I don't want to miss it.  I've been wondering for a long time - can I hear Proverbs, or am I just listening to it?  The other morning I put my ear to it, tried to listen, and this is what I heard:</p>
<p><em>Do not move an ancient landmark / or enter the fields of the fatherless, / for their Redeemer is strong; / he will plead their cause against you.</em></p>
<p>Yahweh, our Abba, is the Redeemer of the fatherless.  This redeeming is not something He does. Redemption is an intrinsic part of Him.  To run the risk of putting too fine a point on it, He <em>is a redeemer</em>.  Take away the redemption and God doesn't become less than Himself.  He becomes something else altogether.  Maybe he becomes an impotent old man, floating in space.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the cosmic heart attack when when Jesus became fatherless on the cross and the Redeemer of the fatherless became sonless?  God's redeemership wasn't called into question so much as a seemingly dormant machine woke up and did what it was designed to do. How could the Redeemer of the fatherless become sonless?  Like a pendulum that'd been waiting at the peak of its swing for eternity past, his redemption rushed into the black hole where his Son once stood.  Down it came with such a great force it killed the death that took His son away from Him, and created an ever growing wake behind it that carried Jesus out of the tomb and continues to carry us all to judgement day.</p>
<p>As much as God's love comes on gently, like the rites of spring, it comes on like a juggernaut.  He charges into the world to redeem the fatherless because he <em>is</em> a Redeemer.  But he doesn't make too much noise about it.  Not while everyone else in the house is sleeping.  Can you hear Him?</p>
